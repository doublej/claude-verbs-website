Claude Verbs are themed spinner verb sets for Claude Code — the animated status messages shown while Claude thinks.

## What you're creating

A JSON file containing 15–100 short action phrases (aim for 50) themed around a subject chosen by the user. The set will be submitted as a pull request to the community repository.

## JSON format

```json
{
  "$schema": "./schema.json",
  "name": "lowercase-kebab-case-name",
  "displayName": "Human-Readable Title",
  "category": "entertainment",
  "description": "A short description of the theme",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "github": "github-username",
  "language": "en_US",
  "config": {
    "spinnerVerbs": {
      "mode": "replace",
      "verbs": [
        "Verb phrase one",
        "Verb phrase two"
      ]
    }
  },
  "authorInfo": {
    "description": "One-sentence bio about the author.",
    "projects": [
      { "name": "project", "url": "https://github.com/user/project", "description": "One sentence." }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Field reference

| Field | Required | Rules |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `name` | Yes | Lowercase kebab-case, must match filename without `.json`. Use a country prefix for localised pop culture (e.g. `uk-peep-show`, `us-the-office`, `jp-gaki-no-tsukai`). No prefix needed for original/universal themes. |
| `displayName` | Yes | Human-readable title shown in listings. |
| `category` | Yes | One of: `entertainment`, `music`, `gaming`, `literature`, `science`, `tech`, `sport`, `culture`, `original`. |
| `description` | Yes | Short phrase describing the theme (e.g. "Portal puzzle adventure spinner verbs"). |
| `author` | Yes | The contributor's name. |
| `github` | Yes | GitHub username (for attribution). |
| `language` | Yes | Locale code in `xx_YY` format (e.g. `en_US`, `nl_NL`, `de_DE`, `fr_FR`, `ja_JP`). |
| `mode` | Yes | `"replace"` (swap default verbs) or `"append"` (add to defaults). Almost always `"replace"`. |
| `verbs` | Yes | Array of 15–100 unique strings. Aim for 50. |
| `authorInfo` | No | Optional object with `description` (one-sentence bio) and `projects` (1–3 projects with `name`, `url`, `description`). Controls how the author appears on claudeverbs.com. If omitted, data is fetched from the GitHub API. |

## Writing good verbs

### Must

- Each verb is a short action phrase (something someone can do).
- 2–6 words per verb.
- No duplicates or near-duplicates (including trivial rewordings).
- No ending punctuation. No emojis.
- Write verbs in the language matching the `language` field.

### Should

- Mix verb styles: say, do, check, avoid, pretend, panic, contemplate, endure, regret, observe, etc.
- Keep it punchy and rhythmic — these scroll by fast in a spinner.
- Aim for "recognisable vibe" without requiring deep lore knowledge.
- Be funny and creative. Bland or generic verbs make a boring set.

### Must not

- Do not prepend verbs with "I'm", "I am", or similar subject prefixes. Claude Code prepends these automatically.
- Do not reproduce long verbatim quotes. Keep catchphrase references to 1–3 words and convert them into actions (e.g. "Say the thing" not the quote itself).
- Do not use bare nouns or standalone quotes as verbs. Every entry must be an action.

## Examples

Good verbs (from a Peep Show set):
- "Rehearse a casual hello"
- "Avoid Big Suze's gaze"
- "Endure Jeremy's latest scheme"
- "Panic about four naan again"
- "Rationalize my poor choices"

Good verbs (from a Portal set):
- "Test the portal gun"
- "Carry the companion cube"
- "Dodge endless laser barrage"
- "Promise cake after testing"
- "Know there's no cake"

Bad verbs (and why):
- "Coffee" — bare noun, not an action
- "I'm thinking about the code" — has "I'm" prefix
- "That's what she said!" — standalone quote with punctuation
- "Do something" — too generic, not themed
- "Recalibrate the quantum flux capacitor matrix" — too long, over 6 words

## Naming conventions

Use a country/region prefix when the theme is tied to a specific culture:
- `uk-peep-show`, `us-the-office`, `au-kath-and-kim`, `fr-kaamelott`
- `us-billie-eilish`, `jp-gaki-no-tsukai`, `kr-infinite-challenge`

Skip the prefix for universal or original themes:
- `idiot`, `multi-lul`

## Step-by-step workflow

1. **Ask the user** for a subject/theme, their preferred language, their name and GitHub username.
2. **Generate the JSON** following the format and rules above.
3. **Ask the user** if they want to add `authorInfo` (optional — for their profile on claudeverbs.com).
4. **Self-check** before showing the result:
   - Count is 15–100?
   - Every entry is an action phrase?
   - No entry exceeds 6 words?
   - No duplicates or near-duplicates?
   - JSON is valid?
   - All required fields present?
   - `name` is lowercase-kebab-case?
5. **Save the file** as `sets/<name>.json`.
6. **Validate** by running `bun run validate.ts` in the repo root.
